## Introduction

First of all, Python is not my strong suit, so there may be sections of the code that could be improved or simplified in fewer lines. However, I believe I have done a decent job with this programming language. Although this first version has been tested countless times, there is still the possibility of it having some errors. I would appreciate it if you could report them by opening an issue in this repository and providing evidence to replicate them.

***Make it sure backup your save file first***.

## Description

The purpose of this project is to enable the conversion of your saved games from `MHXX (3DS)` to `MHGU (Switch)` and vice versa, using three scripts I've developed through reverse engineering to assist you with this challenging task. While there is already an application called [MHXXSwitchSaveEditor](https://github.com/Dawnshifter/MHXXSwitchSaveEditor) that performs this task, it's not particularly effective for converting saved games; its strength lies more in editing them.

One of the issues I encountered with this editor is that it could convert saved games from `MHXX (3DS)` to `MHGU (Switch)`, but not the other way around. I also noticed that this editor breaks the in-game chat menu. If you have more than one saved slot and edit roughly half or more of the chat menu in the saved game from Switch generated by `MHXXSwitchSaveEditor`, it can completely destroy it. This is because the chat menu in the Switch version occupies a larger number of bytes, causing it to overwrite a portion of the second saved slot that is irrecoverable. As a result, this will cause the game to crash when trying to load it.

If the scripts I've developed meet your expectations, I would recommend using `MHXXSwitchSaveEditor` solely for editing your saves, but not for conversion purposes. Also, bear in mind that they are incompatible with each other. Therefore, if you have a Switch saved file resulting from a conversion with `MHXXSwitchSaveEditor`, you will generally need to take an extra step to make it compatible with my conversion scripts.

## How to use

First of all, ***make it sure backup your save file***.

### 1. FIX SAVE - (Extra step if you used `MHXXSwitchSaveEditor` to convert your save)

As I mentioned, this script is an additional step if you have a saved game that was converted from MHXX (3DS) to MHGU (Switch) using `MHXXSwitchSaveEditor`. Therefore, if you haven't performed that conversion, you should skip this section and proceed to section [2](#2-mhgu-to-mhxx---switch-to-3ds) or [3](#3-mhxx-to-mhgu---3ds-to-switch).

The purpose of this section is to make your save file compatible with the script documented in section [2](#2-mhgu-to-mhxx---switch-to-3ds) or simply to try to recover your chats, if that's what you want.

1. Place your Switch `system` file in the root of the `FIX_SAVE - (Switch To Switch)` folder.
2. Run the `fix_save.exe` file or simply `fix_save` for Unix systems.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>To execute the script on a Unix system (Mac/Linux), you need to give it execute permissions by following these steps:
>
> 1. - Open the terminal and enter the following commands:
> 2. - cd `"PATH OF THE SCRIPT ROOT FOLDER"`
> 3. - chmod +x fix_save
> 4. - ./fix_save
>
> Now, this should execute the script in the terminal.


3. The script will prompt you to choose between two options:
   1. Try to recover it - (Mostly recommended if you didn't edit the chats in MHGU).
   2. Replace it with the English version of MHGU.
4. Simply type the number to the left of the option you want to choose.
5. Wait until the script prompts you to press any key to exit, then navigate to the `output - (Switch)` folder. There you should find your new fixed `system` file, which is compatible with section [2](#2-mhgu-to-mhxx---switch-to-3ds).
6. To ensure that the generated file is not damaged, I recommend testing it on your Switch or emulator. If everything goes well, you should find your 3DS version chats in the chat menu. If you chose `option 1` in the script, you may see some strange characters, which is normal as some characters are not supported in the Switch version and vice versa. However, they should now be visible and not appear empty. If you edited them in English, they should display correctly in both versions. On the other hand, if you choose `option 2`, they will be overwritten with the English version of MHGU in all your saved slots.
7. If everything went well, you don't need to continue reading; go directly to section [2](#2-mhgu-to-mhxx---switch-to-3ds) or simply use your new file with the fixed chats on your Switch or emulator.

If you followed the previous steps and the script generated a damaged save file, you can do the following:

1. Try to follow the steps in the section ["Transfer to a blank save"](#transfer-to-a-blank-save---requires-emulator).
2. Repeat the steps of this section if you want to recover your chats, but this time with the saved file obtained in the previously mentioned section. If you don't want to recover your chats, you can simply overwrite the chats from within the game. Keep in mind that they will be overwritten with the language version configured in the game. I have only tested with English and Spanish, so I am unaware of what may happen with other languages. Alternatively, you can redo the script steps and select option 2.
3. If everything went well, your file should now be compatible with section [2](#2-mhgu-to-mhxx---switch-to-3ds). If the script continues to generate a damaged file, use the file obtained in the ["Transfer to a blank save"](#transfer-to-a-blank-save---requires-emulator) section directly. Do not pass it through the script; simply restore the chats from within the game.

The script for this section is something I hadn't planned to develop, but as I found myself in the same situation, I had to create it. After releasing this first version, I won't be dedicating myself to fixing any issues with it. I apologize if the script for this section doesn't work for you after following all the steps. Your only option in that case is to use a saved file that hasn't been converted with `MHXXSwitchSaveEditor` but was originally created by the Switch version or converted using the script from section [3](#3-mhxx-to-mhgu---3ds-to-switch).

### ADD DLC

The 3 scripts do not require you to remove the DLC. These scripts copy the initial bytes from the `system` files found in the `Blank_3DS_Save` and `Blank_Switch_Save` folders, and then insert the remaining bytes to form the new file for the corresponding version.

In summary, the `system` files provided in the `Blank` folders are completely empty and do not contain any DLC. If you want the conversion scripts from sections [2](#2-mhgu-to-mhxx---switch-to-3ds) and [3](#3-mhxx-to-mhgu---3ds-to-switch) to automatically add the DLC to the new files generated in the output folders, you simply need to replace the `system` file in the `Blank` folder of the corresponding version with one that contains the DLC.

It is not necessary for this file to be blank; it just needs to contain the DLC, as mentioned earlier, only the initial part of the file will be copied.

Alternatively, instead of replacing the files in the `Blank` folders, you can simply load them into the corresponding console and download the DLC from there once the new files from sections [2](#2-mhgu-to-mhxx---switch-to-3ds) and [3](#3-mhxx-to-mhgu---3ds-to-switch) have been generated.

> [!WARNING]  
> Please do not delete the `Blank_3DS_Save` and `Blank_Switch_Save` folders or their `system` files; they are essential for the operation of all 3 scripts. However, you can replace the `system` files with other `system` files, either with or without DLC, that correspond to the console version mentioned in their folder.

### 2. MHGU TO MHXX - (Switch To 3DS)

If you are coming from section [1](#1-fix-save---extra-step-if-you-used-mhxxswitchsaveeditor-to-convert-your-save), in the first step, use the `system` file generated by the `FIX_SAVE` script.

1. Place your Switch MHGU `system` file in the root of the `MHGU_TO_MHXX - (Switch To 3DS)` folder
2. Run the `mhgu_to_mhxx.exe` file or simply `mhgu_to_mhxx` for Unix systems.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>To execute the script on a Unix system (Mac/Linux), you need to give it execute permissions by following these steps:
>
> 1 - Open the terminal and enter the following commands:
> 2 - cd `"PATH OF THE SCRIPT ROOT FOLDER"`
> 3 - chmod +x mhgu_to_mhxx
> 4 - ./mhgu_to_mhxx
>
> Now, this should execute the script in the terminal.

3. Wait until the script prompts you to press any key to exit, and then go to the `output - (3DS)` folder. There you should find your new `system` file converted for 3DS MHXX.
4. Test the new save file on your 3DS or emulator.

### 3. MHXX TO MHGU - (3DS To Switch)

1. Place your 3DS MHXX `system` file in the root of the `MHXX_TO_MHGU - (3DS To Switch)` folder
2. Run the `mhxx_to_mhgu.exe` file or simply `mhxx_to_mhgu` for Unix systems.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>To execute the script on a Unix system (Mac/Linux), you need to give it execute permissions by following these steps:

> 4 - ./mhxx_to_mhgu
>
> Now, this should execute the script in the terminal.

3. Wait until the script prompts you to press any key to exit, and then go to the `output - (Switch)` folder. There you should find your new `system` file converted for Switch MHGU.
4. Test the new save file on your Switch or emulator.

### Transfer to a blank save - (Requires emulator) 

***Make it sure backup your save file***

Previously, you had to perform the following steps in the 3DS emulator to remove the DLC before using `MHXXSwitchSaveEditor` to convert your game save. However, with the scripts I developed, it's no longer necessary unless you're experiencing issues with the script from section [1](#1-fix-save---extra-step-if-you-used-mhxxswitchsaveeditor-to-convert-your-save).

In this particular case, you'll need a Switch emulator and you'll need to dump the game from your Switch if you haven't already done so.

1. Go to the MHGU save files directory in the emulator and paste the backup your save file if you didn't already. 
2. Start MHGU on Emulator and load the game and your character slot.
3. Open the folder `Blank_Switch_Save` folder and copy the contents into the contents of your save file directory, it will ask to be replaced the current files, click yes.
4. Go back to MHGU and save the game
5. Restart your game
6. If your character is in the save file, return to section [1](#1-fix-save---extra-step-if-you-used-mhxxswitchsaveeditor-to-convert-your-save)

> [!IMPORTANT]
>It's important not to close either the emulator or the game while performing steps 2 through 4.
>
>Note that the previous steps will only transfer the `slot` you load. Therefore, if you want to transfer another `slot` to the same file, you'll need to repeat the steps. This time, load your previous saved game, of which you should have a backup, and use the saved file from the previous transfer as the content of the `Blank_Switch_Save` folder in step 3.

## Issue with 60fps cheat - (For 3DS emulator)

The following is unrelated to the conversion scripts; it's simply something I discovered on my own. I'm unsure if anyone else has noticed this issue, but I wanted to document it to remember and perhaps it could be useful.

Before trying this, I recommend monitoring your hardware temperatures and usage at all times using software such as HWiNFO or MSI Afterburner's overlay.

When using the 3DS emulator with the 60 fps cheat created by the MHXX community, I noticed frequent frame stutters or drops that prevented me from enjoying a smooth 60 fps experience, despite having a system that far exceeds the requirements (R7 7800X3D, 32GB DDR5, RTX 3080TI). After several tests and unsuccessful internet searches, I came up with the idea of editing the 60 fps cheat itself to values higher than 60. Upon exceeding 140, I began to notice that the issue had been mitigated. To confirm, I left it at 200. While the emulator or game engine doesn't allow for exceeding 60 fps, increasing this value raised the `frametime`, measured in `ms`, which somehow resolved the issue. However, I noticed higher GPU consumption with this new value, so if you want to try this, I advise against values higher than 300 or 400. Before trying, remember to deactivate the 3D effect from the game menu, as it also increases hardware usage. I'm not responsible if your GPU or CPU are damaged after trying this, so I recommend starting with 140 or maybe less, and then gradually increasing if it doesn't work well. You can do this [here](https://gregstoll.com/~gregstoll/floattohex/) by typing, for example, 140 in the float box and then clicking `convert to hex`, it will return the HEX value that you should replace in the penultimate line of the cheat code.

I also experienced this issue in MH3U, so I tried the same approach, but it only worked with a value of 65. If I used higher values, the problem reappeared.

I am unaware of the exact cause of the issue, but I suspect it could be related to the refresh rate of the monitor, especially if it is very high or exceeds 60 Hz.
